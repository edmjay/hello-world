Hello!
My name is Jay Crook. I'm currently a senior at Univ of South Carolina working on a BS of Mechanical Engineering.
I plan on graduating Spring 2019.
I'm 57 years old. I've been in manufacturing all my life. I went thru Machine Trades in high school
and went to work in machine shops around central Ohio.
I've programmed cnc machines for the past 30 years, manually on a flexowriter and then using numerous CAM packages.
The latest packages were PTC Creo and their Pro-NC Complete 5 axis software. I also was using DP Technologies Esprit.
I've had my own edm shop for 10 years and have worked for a machine tool distributor doing applications engineering.
I joined SME this year and will probably end up back in manufacturing.

Thanks,
Jay.
